# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the centralized location for all OctoAcme project management knowledge. This repository contains comprehensive documentation of our project management processes, methodologies, and best practices.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, iterative delivery, and continuous improvement.

### Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first:** Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery:** Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership:** Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions:** Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety:** Encourage feedback and learning without blame

### Project Lifecycle Summary

#### 1. Initiation
Define the foundation of the project by establishing:
- Problem statement and business objectives
- Key stakeholders and their roles
- Project one-pager with goals and success metrics
- Stakeholder alignment and buy-in
- High-level timeline and milestones

#### 2. Planning
Break down the work into manageable, deliverable components:
- Shippable increments with clear boundaries
- Prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
- Scope estimation and resource allocation
- Definition of Done for each deliverable
- Dependencies and risk identification
- Release plan and milestone mapping

#### 3. Execution & Tracking
Maintain momentum through structured collaboration:
- **Meetings:** Daily standups and weekly syncs
- **Project Boards:** Track work through states (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done)
- **PR Workflow:** 
  - Keep PRs small (≤400 lines preferred)
  - Include acceptance criteria in PR descriptions
  - Require at least one approval before merge
- **Testing:** Comprehensive coverage including unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, and security scanning

#### 4. Risk & Communication
Proactively manage uncertainty and maintain transparency:
- **Risk Register:** Document risks with impact/likelihood ratings
- **Risk Reviews:** Weekly assessment of active risks
- **Stakeholder Updates:** Regular communication on progress and blockers
- **Single Source of Truth:** Centralized status reporting
- **Escalation Paths:** Clear procedures for addressing critical issues

#### 5. Release & Deployment
Execute releases with confidence through standardized processes:
- **Release Types:** Follow semantic versioning (patch/minor/major)
- **Pre-Release Requirements:**
  - All CI checks passing
  - Security scans completed with no critical issues
  - Release notes prepared
  - Rollback plan documented and tested
- **Deployment Checklist:** Step-by-step verification
- **Post-Deploy Verification:** Smoke tests and monitoring

#### 6. Retrospective & Improvement
Learn and evolve after each sprint, release, or incident:
- Structured retrospectives with the team
- Focus on what went well and what could improve
- Prioritize 2-3 actionable items with clear owners and due dates
- Measure impact of improvements
- Celebrate successes and learnings

### Key Roles

#### Developers
- Implement features and fixes
- Write tests and documentation
- Participate in code reviews
- Assist with estimation and planning

#### Product Managers
- Define product vision and strategy
- Prioritize backlog based on customer value
- Set success metrics and validate outcomes
- Collaborate on solution design

#### Project Managers
- Coordinate delivery activities
- Manage schedules, dependencies, and risks
- Facilitate meetings and ceremonies
- Ensure documentation and status reporting
- Maintain transparency with stakeholders
